# B-Cosified Stable Diffusion Version 2

This repository contains a B-cosified version of [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion).
B-cos networks are a variation of Deep Neural Networks which promote interpretability. 


This is a fork of of the [Stable Diffusion 2.1](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion) repository.
The code for training was adapted from an open-source [Dreambooth](https://github.com/tomasyany/dreambooth) repository.
The [b-cos library](https://github.com/B-cos/B-cos-v2/) is used whenever possible but some modules have also been copied and modified.

________________________________
  
## Requirements

The requirements mostly match the requirements of Stable Diffusion 2.1. 
However, the minor additions have and changes have not been properly added to the codebase yet. 


#### xformers efficient attention
While the xformers library provides many benefits, it is not (yet) compatible with the B-cos explanation mode.
The adaption should be relatively straight forward but we did not do that yet. 

#### incompatible parts of the code
Some settings are currently not supported despite them not being removed from the code.
The example Jupyter notebook should provide some guidance on how things work.
